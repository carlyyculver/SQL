-- Practicing my MYSQL code on the website leetcode, with SQL 50 questions. Great way to showcase my abilities with MYSQL and writiing queries. 

-- SELECT STATEMENTS --
-- Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

SELECT product_id
FROM products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y'
AND recyclable = 'Y';

-- Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id <> 2 OR referee_id IS null;

-- INFO- A country is big if:it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000).
-- Write a solution to find the name, population, and area of the big countries.

SELECT name, population, area
FROM World 
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;

-- Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles. Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE viewer_id = author_id
ORDER BY author_id ASC

(I used DISTINCT here because the data in the table had multiple article ids with the same author id. I only wanted results for each individual author id.
I also renamed author_id just to id as in the question it distinguished id in ascending order noting the column name was to be id.)

-- Write a solution to find the IDs of the invalid tweets. The tweet is invalid if the number of characters used in the content of the tweet is strictly greater than 15.

SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(content) > 15;

(For the column content the type was identified as varchar. The question asking for the invalid tweet which means the contents had to be greater than 15. So the where clause needed to identify the varchar length to pull the tweet that was greater than 15.
