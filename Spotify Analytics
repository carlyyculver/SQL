*For this project, I downloaded Spotify Data from Kaggle.
*Then I created a table to insert the data into.
*Allowing me to perform analytics on the data using SQL. 

*Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata
( id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

*Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

*Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. I deteremined the top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10;

#2. I also wanted to see what tracks have a feat artist in them, by artist & track
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM spotifydata
WHERE track_name LIKE '%(with%'
OR track_name LIKE '%feat%';


#3. Determined the longest song and its popularity.
SELECT track_name, 
popularity,
max(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata;

#4. Track names that have an instrumentalness less than 0, and danceability greater than 0.7
SELECT track_name, instrumentalness, danceability
FROM spotifydata
WHERE instrumentalness > 0 and danceability > 0.7
