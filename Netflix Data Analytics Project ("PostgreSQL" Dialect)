#1. How many movie titles are in the database?

  SELECT count(*)
  FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
  WHERE type = 'Movie';

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?

  SELECT max(date(date_added))
  FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

  SELECT title
  FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
  ORDER BY title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?

  SELECT director 
  FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
  LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
  ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
  WHERE title = 'Bright Star';

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?

SELECT 
title,
release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 2;

*** I noticed that before adding limit to my query, 2 movies were released the same year making them both the oldest movie in the database. 
So I then knew the limit need to increased to 2 in order to show both movies.
